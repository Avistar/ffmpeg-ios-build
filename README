USAGE

one you have a git clone of this project:
- cd to the directory.
- run `./sync.sh`
- run `cd ffmpeg`
- run `git checkout <desired tag>`
- run `cd ..`
- run `./build.sh`
- When done, copy the contents of "dist-armv7/lib" to "<c3 project>/vendor/doubango/thirdparties/iphone/lib/armv7
- copy the contents of "dist-i386/lib" to "<c3 project>/vendor/doubango/thirdparties/iphone/lib/i386
- copy the contents of "dist-armv7/include" to "<c3 project>/vendor/doubango/thirdparties/iphone/include
- Clean the c3 mobile project
- Compile and fix any errors created by the new version.

Note: the contents of dist-armv7/include and dist-i386/include are always the same, thats why we only copy the one dir for that
